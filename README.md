# Server-player-data-retriever
One of the first projects I've done. <br />
Many amature mistakes however future projects are improved on in code readability, file management, and data usage.<br />

# Utility:
The program opens up an interface where the user can input player names or ask for specific logins. <br />
Once a user has inputted player names then the program will send a request to the API of hypixel and request for the data needed. This can go from stats to play time. <br />
Upon switching off from specific player's then the data will be reset and then the new player's data will be placed into it.
